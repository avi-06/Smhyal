# SmhyalApp

Smhyal is an all-in-one tool for rapid self-diagnosis for two of the most common, yet critical, psychological disorders among young adults: anxiety and depression. The Smhyal algorithm is based on a modified artificial neural network (ANN), with accuracies greater than 94% for anxiety and depression diagnosis. The model was trained on large-scale data for young adults from the publicly-available Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) Mental Health Client Level Data (MH-CLD) survey set. The model was developed by Avi Verma, under the guidance of Dr. Kaustubh Supekar at Stanford University.
